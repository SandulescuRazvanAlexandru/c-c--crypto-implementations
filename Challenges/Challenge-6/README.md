# MessageDigest C++ Wrapper for OpenSSL

## Overview
This project provides a C++ wrapper class for OpenSSL's message digest functionality. The `MessageDigest` class allows for easy computation of message digests using different algorithms.

## Assignment Requirements
1. **Class Implementation**:
    - Define and implement the `MessageDigest` class as a wrapper for OpenSSL message digest functionality.
    - The class must contain static fields for supported message digest algorithms, constructors, methods for content digestion, a method for retrieving the digest result, and a destructor if necessary.

2. **Main Functionality**:
    - Implement the `main()` function to demonstrate the message digest functionality with two different algorithms.
    - The computed message digests are printed to the console.
